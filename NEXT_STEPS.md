# 🎯 NEXT STEPS - YOUR AI TERMINAL ROADMAP

**What to do next to complete your cyberpunk AI command center**

---

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### **1. Restart Claude Code (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# Your MCPs won't work until you restart Claude Code
# Close Claude Code completely and reopen it
```

### **2. Test Your Setup**
```bash
# Run the test script to verify everything works
~/test-terminal-power.sh

# Test voice commands
voice  # Try: "show me my supabase projects"

# Test GitHub search
ghsearch "deno fresh auth" repositories
```

### **3. Missing API Keys Setup**
You currently have these APIs configured:
- ✅ OpenAI (Whisper + DALL-E)
- ✅ Google (YouTube, Calendar, Gmail)
- ✅ GitHub (Code search)
- ✅ Supabase (Database operations)

**Still needed for full power:**
```bash
# Edit your ~/.zshrc and add these when you get them:
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_key_here"      # Voice generation
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"   # Better AI models
export RAILWAY_TOKEN="your_token_here"         # Easy deployment
export STEAM_API_KEY="your_key_here"           # Game management

# Then reload your shell:
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## 🎬 **RECOMMENDED TESTING SEQUENCE**

### **Phase 1: Basic Functionality**
```bash
# 1. Test file operations
"Convert this PDF to markdown"
"Take a screenshot and save to Desktop"

# 2. Test AI features
"Generate a simple desktop wallpaper using DALL-E"
"Use Hugging Face to summarize this text"

# 3. Test voice commands
voice  # "create a new deno project called test-app"
```

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features**
```bash
# 1. Test database operations
"Show me my Supabase projects and tables"
"Create a test table with basic fields"

# 2. Test email automation
"Show me my recent unread emails"
"Find emails about work or business"

# 3. Test system automation
"Organize my Downloads folder by file type"
"Create a backup of my important files"
```

### **Phase 3: Workflow Integration**
```bash
# 1. Create a complete webapp
"Create a new SaaS app with Deno Fresh and Supabase authentication"

# 2. Use voice + GitHub discovery
voice  # "find examples of deno middleware for authentication"
# Then run the suggested GitHub search

# 3. Try creative workflows
"Generate cover art for my project and set as wallpaper"
```

## 🛠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST**

### **If Voice Commands Don't Work:**
```bash
# Check OpenAI API key
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Test microphone access
# Go to: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Microphone
# Enable access for Terminal/iTerm2

# Reinstall ffmpeg if needed
brew reinstall ffmpeg
```

### **If GitHub Search Fails:**
```bash
# Check GitHub token
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Authenticate GitHub CLI
gh auth login
# Or set token directly:
export GH_TOKEN="$GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

### **If MCPs Don't Load:**
```bash
# List currently active MCPs
claude mcp list

# Check MCP logs in Claude Code:
# View > Output > MCP

# Restart Claude Code completely
```
